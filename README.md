My interest in software began in middle school with a GameMaker project I developed. During high school, I created products for Windows and Android platforms. In university, I professionally developed mobile applications for both Android and iOS. I have been actively involved in desktop, web, mobile, gaming, service, and database projects. I have a particular interest in layered architecture, error handling, logging systems, and sustainable software development processes. Additionally, I have extensive experience in system and network management through servers I personally manage.

I am also open to freelance or contract opportunities in database, API, UI development, and system/network management.
