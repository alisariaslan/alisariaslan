I am a Software Developer with end-to-end product development
experience across mobile, desktop, and web platforms. I have
contributed to the architectural design and development of
scalable commercial products actively used within the Android and
iOS ecosystems. I have built integrated solutions aligned with Clean
Architecture, MVVM, and microservice-based approaches, working
closely with backend services, external integrations, and database
layers. I have also taken an active role in CI/CD pipelines, server
management, and app store release processes to ensure products
are deployed to production in a secure and sustainable manner.
